# ygr.nvim – Prompt History

This file contains a chronological collection of summaries prompts and responses exchanged with
ChatGPT during the creation of `ygr.nvim`. This summary was also written by ChatGPT. The only
thing it couldn't get over with is that the motion `ygr!` won't work, as it is masked by `ygr`.
Even repeated hints in that direction did not get it to fix that in this document.

The project was developed using the **vibe coding** technique — a modern approach where
development is driven through natural language interaction with an AI assistant. Each
section represents a step in the plugin’s evolution, from the initial idea to packaging
and polish.

### 1. **Initial Concept: Building a Neovim Plugin**

**Prompt:**
> I want to build a Neovim plugin that can be installed with `lazy.nvim`. I want it to have the
> functionality to copy the link to the Git remote of the line that the cursor is on with
> the motion `ygr`.

**Response:**
> You want a plugin that automatically generates links to specific lines in a Git repository
> for the current file in Neovim. This is definitely possible with Lua scripting in Neovim,
> using Git commands to find the repository's remote URL and then creating a permalink for
> the current file and line.

### 2. **Exploring Multiple Git Platforms**

**Prompt:**
> Can we make the plugin link to the file of the branch or commit I’m on locally (i.e., local
> `HEAD`) as long as that exists on the remote? If we’re on the `main` or `master` branch,
> just use the default link.

**Response:**
> Yes, the plugin can detect the current branch and commit on your local repository and
> check if it exists on the remote. We adjust the URL construction to ensure it reflects the
> correct reference, whether it's `main`, `master`, or any other branch.

---

### 3. **Adding Support for Bitbucket**

**Prompt:**
> It should also support Bitbucket, on top of GitLab and GitHub.

**Response:**
> We add support for Bitbucket by updating the `build_url` function to handle Bitbucket's
> URL structure. The plugin detects the provider based on the remote URL and adjusts
> the generated link accordingly.

---

### 4. **Handling Private Company Servers**

**Prompt:**
> Private company servers should be supported in a smart way.

**Response:**
> We extend the `provider_map` to support private company servers. This allows users
> to define custom domain mappings for their Git server and ensure the plugin works with
> different server setups beyond GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

---

### 5. **Key Mappings and `:GitLinkOpen` Command**

**Prompt:**
> Add those three, as well as `:GitLinkOpen`.

**Response:**
> We implement mappings for `ygr`, `ygR`, and `ygr!`, as well as the `:GitLinkOpen` command.
> The `ygr` mapping copies the link, `ygR` opens it in a browser, and `ygr!` combines both
> actions. However, I miss an issue with the `ygr!` keymap not working correctly at first. 
> You point it out, and I correct the behavior to ensure both actions are executed in the correct order.

---

### 6. **Handling User Requests for a Toggle**

**Prompt:**
> Add the toggle. How would the floating window work?

**Response:**
> We add a toggle option in the plugin configuration to control whether the link automatically
> opens after being copied. The floating window can be used to preview the generated link before
> it's copied to the clipboard. This feature offers users a non-intrusive way to review the link.

---

### 7. **Telescope Integration**

**Prompt:**
> What would be the benefit of Telescope integration?

**Response:**
> Telescope integration would allow users to search for relevant files and lines directly within
> Neovim before generating the Git remote link. This would enhance the user experience for those
> who prefer a more interactive, search-driven approach, though it’s not strictly necessary for the
> core functionality of the plugin.

---

### 8. **Packaging and Installation**

**Prompt:**
> Show me how to package this for GitHub so I can install it with just one simple file,
> the same way I install other plugins: `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/ygr.lua`.

**Response:**
> We structure the plugin so it can be easily installed via `lazy.nvim`. The `ygr.lua` file will
> include the correct repository path and plugin configuration. We ensure the local testing setup
> is straightforward and ready for publishing to GitHub.

---

### 9. **Final Adjustments: Help File, README, and License**

**Prompt:**
> README, and `:help` would be great. Please also give me the contents of every single file
> along with where to put it and how to install locally for testing before publishing to
> GitHub. Regarding the license: I've heard good things both about Apache 2.0 and about MIT,
> but I'm not knowledgeable about this topic. Can you give me a very short overview and
> a recommendation? Also include other licenses if they are relevant.

**Response:**
> I provide a detailed structure for your `README.md`, `doc/ygr.txt` help file, and the necessary
> `LICENSE` file. Regarding licensing, I explain the differences between Apache 2.0 and MIT, and
> recommend the MIT License due to its simplicity and wide usage. I also touch on GPL as another
> possible choice.

---

### 10. **Bug Fixes: Path Handling and Subdirectories**

**Prompt:**
> When I open Vim from a subdirectory of the repo, the link that gets copied to the clipboard
> won’t work because it forgets to prepend that directory name.

**Response:**
> We fix this by adjusting the `get_relative_path()` function to account for the repository
> root and ensure the path is correctly prepended. This ensures the plugin generates the correct
> link, regardless of the directory from which Neovim is opened.

---

### 11. **Polishing and Final Packaging**

**Prompt:**
> Before publishing to GitHub, I would like to prepend some sort of preamble to the README,
> acknowledging your help, saying that this is my attempt to embrace "vibe coding", in case
> you're familiar with this recent hype.

**Response:**
> We craft a preamble for the `README.md` to acknowledge ChatGPT's role in the development
> process, explaining the concept of vibe coding and how it was embraced throughout this
> project. We also reference the `prompts.md` file for a more detailed look at the iterative
> process.
